📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis
🧩 Project Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign data to identify which channels and campaigns generate the highest Return on Investment (ROI) and engagement.
The dataset contains user interactions, impressions, clicks, conversions, costs, and revenue — allowing us to evaluate the performance of each marketing effort.

🧠 Objectives

Understand user behavior across different marketing channels.

Calculate and compare key marketing metrics (CTR, Conversion Rate, ROI).

Identify the most cost-effective campaigns.

Provide data-driven insights for optimizing marketing spend.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: pandas, matplotlib

Google Colab – for analysis and visualization

GitHub – for version control and project documentation

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Loading & Exploration – inspected dataset structure and summary statistics (df.info(), df.describe()).

Data Cleaning – checked for missing values and duplicates.

KPI Calculation – calculated CTR, Conversion Rate, Cost per Acquisition, and ROI.

Aggregation & Analysis – grouped data by channel and campaign.

Visualization – created bar charts for CTR by channel and ROI by campaign.

Insights Summary – interpreted trends and performance patterns.

📈 Key Findings

Social Media generated the highest activity, but Referral had the highest CTR.

Campaign 3 showed the best ROI (~800%), while Campaign 6 performed the weakest (~400%).

Referral channels may drive fewer users, but they convert at a higher rate — indicating strong lead quality.

🚀 Next Steps

Add deeper campaign-level visualizations (e.g., revenue vs. cost trends).

Expand analysis by user demographics (age, region).

Export summarized metrics to Power BI for interactive dashboards.
